Testing yes! Done with the back-to-back testing and on with the real stuff! This week i assembled my complete test set. It will be a combination of tests where we expect differences and where we won't expect differences. For example when you are sending large packages (1000 bytes) the impact of the larger IP header caused by IPv6 will be less compared to smaller packages. When testing on a real platform I also have to cope with the problems of a real platform. This week the platform I'm testing on had a couple issues, forcing me to wait or do different things than testing. Wednesday afternoon i helped Thomas and Stijn a bit with docker. Which was really fun to help others and do something in return.
