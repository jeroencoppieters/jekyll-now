title: Time to get rolling
---

After the week of PQA the real deal begins now. I my research around IPv6 (ironicaly) the first part IPv4 is almost done. I Thought it was intresting to include a small part around IPv4 to freshen up my mind (and the mind of those reading it). When diving through all the information about IPv6 it is easy to get lost. Collecting the right information will be a big challenge. This week while exploring IPv6 I stumbled on a feature called "IPv6 Mobility" (link below) it might be interesting to give it a shot, and see what it is doing and how Newtec could use it. However I think it will fall out of the scope of the bachelor thesis. 
This week I started to make a list of the different tests I will be executing I allready have a rough idea but the list is far from complete. the first test I'll be doing will for sure be perfomance tests using an IXIA chassis. 
Beside the research this week I got two trainings, one on using and setting up the Dialog platform given by Thomas D'haenens, it was 'cool' to get on the buttons and setting up a Dialog platform. The other one was on the IXIA testing chassis for which i have to thank Constantin Porcariu, who have explained it in a very clear way!
