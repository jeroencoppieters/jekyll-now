title: Design and write a test set. 
---

After a week-long holiday, it is time to hit the gas and go for it! Currently I did the theoretical study, I gained knowledge about the Dialog system. Together with the team in Berlin I discussed how my tests should look like.  

I did a lot of experimenting with the testing tools, I now know how they work and how to use them. 

After this extensive preparation it is time to start defining my exact tests. I started designing and calculating a test set that seams feasible and promises to test as accurate as possible. I have 6 tests in my test set that I will try to execute and analyze to conclude my study. 

I have been asked to give a presentation about what I have been doing, this way our team knows what I have been doing and I can test my presentation skills.
