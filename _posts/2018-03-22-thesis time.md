--- 

  

This week was the first time I had to deliver to college. The preliminary study must be submitted next week. The preliminary study, contains a rough overview of all the theoretical study i will have to do to execute and understand the tests.  

It was cool to see the cooperation with everybody from the team. When I had to choose a testing method, everybody was keen to give input. The IPv6 part is something I did a bit more independent, it is however good to receive feedback from various sides. 

There is still a small problem with the confidentiality of some diagrams, but I suspect it will be fixed soon.
