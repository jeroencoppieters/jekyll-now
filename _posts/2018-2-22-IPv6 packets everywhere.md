title: IPv6 Packets Everywhere
---

It feels like the student life is slowly disappearing, with al his upsides and downsides. This week it can describe very briefly: "IPv6 Desktop Research" , IPv6 IPv6, IPv6 and a little bit of IPv4. As a venture towards the deeper function of the IP protocols it is easy to drown in the sea of information, finding and using only the relevant information will be the biggest challenge. The information needs to be compact enough so it easy to find the right information. On the other hand it needs to be complete enough to be valuable. 
I also started to get rid of the thirdparty schemes and started to draw my own schemes and diagrams, now i can make them exactly how i want them. 
FYI i got so deep in to the RFC Documentation that is stumbled on these two https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149 and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2549 it sure worth to take a look! See you next week!
