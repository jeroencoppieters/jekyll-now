title: Delivering the first part
---

A really short summary this week, I have been working on delivering the first part of the desktop study, quite happy with the result. Next to the study I also started back-to-back testing on IXIA mainly to get the hang of the dialog configuration. And to get used to some testing. To further improve my research i reached out to the berlin team.
