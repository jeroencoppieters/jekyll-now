Tuesday 3 pm, meeting room A04, Presentation Time!!

I used the first two days to prepare and present my first presentation at Newtec. Summarizing what I have done in the last two months was not easy, I have done a lot and I can't tell everything in the presentation. Even though I know this, it was the biggest feedback on the presentation: be more selective in what to tell.  

In the second half of the week I executed test one and two from my test set. After a couple weeks preparing this, suffering from platform outages, struggling with the system. Everything came together, and I could finally run tests that I will use in my bachelor thesis. 

At a first glance the results of the test seem to indicate that the tests are running correct. After we did some tweaks and tricks in how we will monitor the performance. I could run the tests and save the correct statistics.
